# Assignment 2 (BCSC0001)

Write C programs for the following questions. Use looping constructs (for, while or do-while). You can use any/either combination for solving the problem.

1. Write a program to produce the multiplication table of 1 to 9 as shown, using nested loops.

   ```
   *|	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9
    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
    1	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9  
    2	2	4	6	8	10	12	14	16	18  
    3	3	6	9	12	15	18	21	24	27  
    4	4	8	12	16	20	24	28	32	36  
    5	5	10	15	20	25	30	35	40	45  
    6	6	12	18	24	30	36	42	48	54  
    7	7	14	21	28	35	42	49	56	63  
    8	8	16	24	32	40	48	56	64	72  
    9	9	18	27	36	45	54	63	72	81

2. Write a program which prints the numbers from 1 to 55, 11 numbers per line. The program shall print "Do" in place of the numbers which are multiples of 3, "Re" for multiples of "5", "Mi" for multiples of 7, "DoRe" for multiples of 3 and 5, and so on. The output shall look like

   ```1	2	Do	4		Re	Do	Mi	8		Do	Re		11  
   Do	13	Mi	DoRe	16	17	Do	19    Re	DoMi	22  
   23	Do	Re	26    Do	Mi	29	DoRe	31	32		Do  
   .... (and so on)  

3. Write a program to calculate and print the sums of even and odd integers of the first n natural numbers.

   ```
   Enter the number up to which you want to calculate:  
   25  
   The sum of even integers is 156  
   The sum of odd integers is 169  

4. Write a program to input three numbers `a`, `b` and `c` and print their values in descending order.


   ```
   Enter three numbers:  
   22  
   42  
   56  
   The numbers in descending order are:  
   56	42	22  

5. Write a program to tabulate the function.

   
   x = (x^2 + 1.5x + 5) / (x - 3)  
   
   for x = [-10, 10] -- > -10 to 10  

   x should take values -10, -8, -6, ... , 6, 8, 10  

   The output shall look like  

   ```
   For x = -10    f(x) = -6.923077  
   For x = -8     f(x) = -5.181818  
   For x = -6     f(x) = -3.555556  
   For x = -4     f(x) = -2.142857  
   For x = -2     f(x) = -1.2  
   For x = 0      f(x) = -1.666667  
   For x = 2      f(x) = -12  
   For x = 4      f(x) = 27  
   For x = 6      f(x) = 16.666666  
   For x = 8      f(x) = 16.200001  
   For x = 10     f(x) = 17.142857
