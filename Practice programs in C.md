* Read the following game logic,

  > Player A rolls a dice, if the number is either 1 or 3 or 5, then player B will move twice as much.
  >
  > ​	(1 * 2, 3 * 5, 5 * 5)
  >
  > Player A rolls a dice, if the number is either 4 or 6, then player A will move thrice as much.
  >
  > ​	(4 * 3, 6 * 3)
  >
  > Player A rolls a dice, if the number is 6, then player A moves 10 steps and player B moves 6 steps.
